## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
library(ggplot2)
plot<-ggplot(cars,aes(x=dist,y=speed))
plot+geom_point()+geom_smooth()
```

Note that the `echo = TRUE` parameter was added to the code chunk to print of the R code that generated the plot.
